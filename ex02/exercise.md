# Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN

Write a program that contains:

- A string variable initialized to "HI THIS IS BRAIN".
- stringPTR: a pointer to the string.
- stringREF: a reference to the string.

Your program must print:

- The memory address of the string variable.
- The memory address held by stringPTR.
- The memory address held by stringREF.

And then:

- The value of the string variable.
- The value pointed to by stringPTR.
- The value pointed to by stringREF.

That's allâ€”no tricks. The goal of this exercise is to demystify references, which may
seem completely new. Although there are some small differences, this is simply another
syntax for something you already do: address manipulation.
